# Section 3: Python Challenge

# You are tasked with calculating the minimum classes we need to have so we know how many people to employ. Write a function which when
# given a number of students, calculates and prints out a string for your proposed number of classes, and a dictionary showing the allocation.
#
# Key Constraints:
# The maximum size of a class is 30
# There needs to be a minimum of 2 classes
# The distribution of each class should be as even as possible.
# We want to hire as little people as possible - so where possible focus on bigger classes, and less of them!



#define the function
def num_of_classes(students):
    #define edge cases
    if students < 60:
        raise Exception("There must be more than 60 students to allow us to have at least 2 classes")
    if students < 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot be a negative number of students")
    if not students == ():
        # divide students by 30. round up to whole number so we know how many classes/ instructors we need.
        base_classes = students / 30

        allocation = []
        # if there are under 30 students in a list then carry on adding a student.
        while students in allocation <= 30:
            # adding students to each class so the students are divided equally between the classes.
            # unsure but something with a loop in a loop where it appends to each list. number of lists is determined by base_classes.
            for i in students:
                for j in range(base_classes):
                    # create the base_classes number of dictionaries
                    return allocation.append(len(students))  # we need the number of students in each class not the list of them

        print({f"class {base_classes + 1}: " + allocation})  # need to add one each time we start a new class number for the output the follow with the list
